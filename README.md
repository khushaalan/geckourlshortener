### Scaffolding Tools
- Rails generators were used to scaffold the initial application structure. Then, the generated code was modified to suit the requirements of the application.




**Note:** The web application is deployed on Render using the free basic plan. The free instance on Render will spin down with inactivity, so it may take a few seconds to load the application.
